# AppleCatchRobotics
Apple Catch is a fun, competitiv single-player game where you have to catch falling apples into your basket. This game will test your reflexes and frustrate you until you beat your highscore. It is inspired by a romanian game where you have to catch falling beers.

# Rules

The rules of the game are pretty simple. You have to catch as many falling apples as possible. In time, the frequency of the apples will increase considerably and you'll have to handle the basket as preemtive. If you fail to catch an apple, the game will stop.
